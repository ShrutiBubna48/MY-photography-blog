        <H1>The photography blogs that made me a better photographer</H1>

        <pre>
            Photography blogs are dead!

            At least that’s what I’d like to say.

            We’re in 2023 and it seems video content rules the internet. You see, as much as I enjoy learning through Youtube, blogs have played a major role in teaching me photography.

            Now I know there is a very small percentage of the population…really tiny percent that still enjoys reading blogs even though blogs aren’t popular anymore. If you are one of us, this article is for you.

In this article, I will be sharing some photography blogs that have made me a better photographer
        </pre>

        <h2>1. Strobist</h2>
        <p>If I only had to pick one blog for this article, it would be Strobist. I can’t even remember how I came
            across this blog, but everything I know about lighting mostly came from here.

            I started from Lighting 101 and gradually made my way up. I even bought the Godox TT600 as recommended by
            the author. Strobist is responsible for how I use Flash and how I’m able to take photos such as the one
            below. I absolutely recommend it to anyone interested in learning how to light.</p>

        <h2>
            2. Fstoppers
        </h2>
        <p>Fstoppers was my entryway into the worldwide photography community. It was the place I went to find
            inspiration and see the kind of work professional photographers were making all over the world.

            There are so many photographers across multiple genres on Fstoppers. In addition, the blog posts were
            perfect for a newbie like me who just wanted to consume as much photography information as I could find.

            Anyone interested in learning photography may find their courses useful as well as current news about the
            photography industry.</p>
